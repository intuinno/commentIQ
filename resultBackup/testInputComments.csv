Part of the art of medicine is to how best to explain the diagnoses, treatment and prognoses of a patient's conditions that gives the patient a fair assessment of his or her situation but also reasonable hope for the future (including planning for one's death).  Nobody said that it was easy.  The principles of medical ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice) means that we need to consider the risks vs. benefits of the approach that we take.  If a physician is truly worried about possible self-harm due to a patient knowing the truth, I would suggest consultation with a psychiatrist, the physicians who are the experts on these issues and who may be able to offer treatment as indicated.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that lying to patients is a losing proposition.

153556,NULL,"The BDS does not have a secret agenda to end Israel as a Jewish state; this objective is quite explicit. As a committed Leftist, I encounter the argument against a Jewish Israel almost daily from many of my friends and academic colleagues. The recent endorsement of BDS by the ASA gives equal weight to the end of the occupation AND the end of ""apartheid"" inside Israel. (You can read the often contradictory claims for yourself on their website.) The Electronic Intifada site is equally clear: the authors regard Israel itself as an apartheid state and explicitly aim to end its Jewish identity. <br/><br/>There is an appealing logic to the argument, which sets out from the observation that the era of the nation-state is closing and that nationalisms in general promote ethnocentrism incompatible with open, pluralistic democracies. From this vantage, Zionism looks a lot like the last vestige of colonialism and ethno-nationalism. A Jewish state looks like an ethnocentric project of domination. And this line of reasoning is laid out explicitly by many leading intellectual supporters of BDS, many of them Jews, who regard Zionist appeals to the long history of anti-semitism as rationalizations for a form of racism.<br/><br/>Those of us who support both pluralistic democracy and the notion of a Jewish homeland are challenged to reconcile Zionism's nationalist discourse with our ethical aspirations. BDS was designed to exploit this difficulty. Its overt aim is not peace but the end of Jewish Israel.

But there are consequences: the hot greasy liquid (not found on most pizzas in Italy) can slide down your hand, wrist and arm, giving you a burn and messing up your clothes. And that bite of scorching hot pizza burns the roof of your mouth (New Yorkers know pizza burn as much as the freezing burn that comes from eating ice cream in big slurps). Italians eat their pizza by fork so that it can cool for a moment and not cause that burn. Many of them prefer the coppetta (little cup) and paddle-like spoon for their gelato so that they stay clean and don't get gelato burn. Put another way: Italians savor their food.

The wine didn't change much with the meal, still exhibiting fresh fruity flavors and good structure. After sitting overnight in an open carafe, the wine was still going strong the next afternoon with lots of fruit left and a hint of some developing green characteristics. Overall a very nice wine.

Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, canon law may or may not require the husband to provide a Get to a wife who is requesting one. If religious law is being followed, a demand for a Get can only be implemented if it meets religious laws requirements that allow it to be involuntarily demanded.<br/><br/>There are some very rare circumstances where religious law permits coercion on the husband to compel a Get.

Many helpers are themselves mothers who leave their own children behind to take care of other children in Hong Kong.  Taking care of other people's children  might make sense if, at the end of the day, you can return home to your own children, but the law in HK requires employers to allow the helpers to return home (and pay for the trip) only once every two years.  Helpers are on special two-year work visas and are not eligible for permanent residency as virtually all other foreigners are.

The mission of the Court is to be the final arbiter of disputes arising under Federal law, and to resolve disputes between sovereign states.

(Remember Andrew Jackson's displeasure? ""The Supreme Court has made their ruling; now let them enforce it."") This is why the Dred Scott and Korematsu decisions are universally regarded as the worst decisions ever to emanate from the Supreme Court, because in each instance, the Court put the Constitution aside and demurred to popular passion. Look at Miranda, Gideon v. Wainwright, Loving v. Virginia, Brown v. Bd of Ed., or Roe v.

It is true that the eyes of a decapitated head are immobile, the pupils dilated; fortunately, they cannot see, and if they exhibit no signs of disturbance, none of the characteristic opalescence of a cadaver, they at least have no capacity for movement:  their transparency is that of life, but their fixity is mortal. All this may last minutes, even hours, in a healthy subject: death is not immediate. . . . Thus each vital element survives decapitation to some extent.

How dare they?<br/><br/>Gov Cuomo needs to answer for his own role in this charade.<br/><br/>The thing about lying in politics is that once a politician is caught at it, nothing else that he or she says can be trusted.<br/><br/>Gov Cuomo may have just reached this point, fittingly, in a team effort with his good friend, Gov Christie.<br/><br/>Now let's see him talk his way out of this. Because the evidence presented here doesn't look good, and we New Yorkers are entitled to answers from our own governor for his role in this outrageous attempt to dupe us.<br/><br/>@ricfouad",2014-03-11 08:52:17,266,Ric Fouad,,NULL,11316432,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/nyregion/even-before-fort-lee-lane-closings-port-authority-was-a-christie-tool.html,1,1

To start, the traits of these seeds easily spread to other plants, and Monsanto has been very aggressive in suing farmers when those traits appear in fields that have not been sown with purchased seeds.  Such cross pollination is inevitable, and not always desirable -- a farmer growing for the organic food market really does not want his/her crops to have those traits, and beyond that the legal action taken by Monsanto needlessly increases the cost of those organic foods or forces the farmers out of business.  Even more objectionable, though, is the fact that some GMO seeds are designed to produce crops that do not themselves produce fertile seeds, and that trait has also been shown to spread to other plants.

The whole debacle is a blight on the church and key reason for the mass exodus of congregants.<br/><br/>So I certainly wish Francis had owned up to these crimes in addition to blasting love of money and trickle down economics in countries like the US with growing poverty levels.<br/><br/>But the other thing I find fascinating, more from a cultural perspective, is this oblique nature of his words.  The author's statement “But his words are always calculated and a bit enigmatic.” couldn't have been better described.  This leaves us with a world full of weary and spiritually longing Catholics reading whatever they want into Francis' ""elliptical"" utterances.  <br/><br/>Folks have made Francis a blank slate on which to write their own deepest desires: for more pragmatic views on sexuality, marriage of priests, ordination of women, and everything else ""modern"" they want to see in Catholic teachings and practice.  <br/><br/>And I think is very dangerous, because words only go so far without action to back them up. It could create further backlash and alienation of Catholics if they don't see real changes regarding the roles of women and men in the church.

How can it not be suspect when they themselves (B.D.S.) apparently cannot acknowledge the ambiguity of their position, that a person cannot determine whether antisemitism is in fact occurring?

I would go so far as to say I support Israel for that fact alone, that apparently Arabs cannot form a decent economy unless with a lot of oil.   Even if the Arabs do have good intentions toward the Israeli Jews, how can they back up those good intentions when they insist on having backward economies? The Israeli Jews are obligated to defend themselves, remain separate and with secure power just to have a viable economy.

Waving the magic wand of Doppler effect does not explain how the northern direction was ""eliminated"". The satellite is geo-stationary so the two arcs are mirror images of each other as are any potential flight paths. I can imagine only two possible analyses that would differentiate between the two paths but both would require time clock measurements orders of magnitude more precise than needed for measuring the relative speed of a plane since it would involve the comparison of two measures that are very close to each other. One would be if the satellite had a slight rotation or wobble and if they could tell which direction it (the sat) was moving at the exact moment each ping was received. The other is if the slight difference in the distance of each arc from the equator combined with the equatorial bulge of the Earth made a slight difference in the predictions for the two arcs. Either of these would require a degree of precision that it is hard to imagine in a system that wasn't even designed for these purposes. It is absolutely criminal that the Malaysians and other authorities including the US are dismissing the northern possibility w/o even revealing HOW (in principle if not detail) Doppler measurements were used to support this conclusion.

My judgement is that the decision to plagiarize the apology for plagiarism is neither “clever” nor “pathological.” It was more of a subtle demonstration for his belief that plagiarism is OK. Perhaps in retaliation to the consequences, it seems to me that he is using “I am not famous anymore” and “I am sorry” as punchlines to jokes. LaBeouf knows that these “abnormal” activities will cause a public frenzy. The joke is on us now, because we pay attention to these events and in a twisted way, acknowledge his stance on plagiarism.

Before eating:  Aroma deep, fruity, rich, full grape smell - smells like a good Bordeaux.  Smells smooth and mellow and fruity.  First taste before eating:  More savory than sweet; rich, smoky.  Texture - medium tannins with a little acidity.  While eating roast chicken and roasted root vegetables:  When it first goes on the palate, it tastes a little acidic, then becomes more earthy.  It's both tannic and acidic, but more tannic.  After starting to eat, it tastes smooth with a little zing.  When it first goes in the mouth it's smooth.  Then you feel an earthy zing.  It's more smoky than fruity.  The more I drink, the more it opens up in my mouth.  By the second glass it really opens up like a flower opening up in your mouth.  This wine is great with goat cheese.  It tastes sweeter with the cheese.  The texture has a snappy vivacity - it makes you want to savor it and take another sip.  We also tried it with dessert, an apricot pistachio tart.  I thought it was a nice counterpart to the sweetness of the tart, but my husband thought it did not go with the dessert.

508328,NULL,"A brief lesson in antiquity analysis.  In the period of time from the actual event and the death of eye witnesses, historical legend development begins.  Since Jesus died in approximately 33 AD (confirmed in non-Christian texts like Josephus, Pliny the Elder and Tacitus), the early church only accepted text written within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses to His life.  So, the New Testament texts start around 50AD and end around 80AD.  Only direct eyewitness accounts were accepted into canon (current Bible).  There are roughly 24,000 texts and pieces of texts from that period to support the current New Testament.  The next closest document in antiquity with that amount of written evidence is Homer.<br/>The Gnostic gospels (Gospel of Thomas, others) which are so famous today, were written between 200AD and 800AD.  Because they were written long after the eyewitnesses had died, they are biased by historical legend development.  That is, they are based on hearsay.   The reason the Gnostic gospels were not selected for the New Testament was the lack of eyewitness testimony.  <br/><br/>The reason the US Court system accepts eye witness accounts and not second hand accounts is reliability.  That is, the eyewitnesses were there.  Otherwise, it is hearsay evidence.    That is why the early church did not accept Gospels written 200-300 years later.  It was the lack of eyewitness testimony, not some Dan Brown like conspiracy. The New Testament is the most attested document in history.

I'm a concerned citizen, and I think it's a good thing that more and more people are getting covered. Do you think it's bad for people to have health insurance? Do you? Before the ACA, people without insurance waited to seek medical care until things became much more severe, and then they are unable to pay the extremely high medical bills, which ends up costing everyone of us more. Do you think that was better?",2014-04-01 17:22:21,1,Robert Lyon,,NULL,11470437,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/us/health-website-failures-impede-signup-surge-as-deadline-nears.html,0,1

Additional devolution of power to Crimea would further empower the ethnic Russian majority, and in the current circumstances few could argue this would be a good idea.  Already for fifteen years now, despite a Russo-Ukrainian treaty of friendship and cooperation which explicitly recognizes Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea, Moscow has been granting Russian passports to Russian-speakers in Crimea, just as it did to south Ossetians and Abkhazians to incite anti-Georgian separatism and undermine the Georgian republic.  That led to war between Russia and Georgia.<br/><br/>While ethnic Russians currently constitute over half of the Crimean population, one-quarter is Ukrainian and almost fifteen per cent is made up of the original Crimean Tatar inhabitants.  In 1944 the entire Crimean Tatar population was ethnically cleansed by Stalin (and replaced by Russian colonists), during which almost half the Tatar population died of maltreatment.)  Only in the final days of the Soviet Union were Crimean Tatars allowed to return from central Asia to their homeland. <br/><br/>Given the placement of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea, along with the large number of Russians who chose the temperate Crimea for retirement, Crimea is an inviting soft spot for Moscow mischief making.

Russia will feel emboldened by the lack of costs and their seemingly easy ability to divide countries vis-a-vis particular interests.

The Germans depend too much on energy and industrial sectors. Cypress clearly is a weak link; Russia accounts for a significant portion of their economy and is easily pushed into a financial hardship. Each country has its own interests to be sure.  Maybe the EU should divide costs proportionally and guarantee each other no one country is singled out.  Russia will continue to drive wedges wherever they see opportunity.

Any investment a company makes to reduce carbon emissions will have both an immediate negative impact on its bottom line with the results benefiting its competitors.  We will have to move beyond capitalism to a new global economic system that rewards process over profits.  We have to develop a new metric that assigns prosperity to processes that reduce carbon emissions instead of just making the cheapest goods.  Otherwise, there is no mechanism in pure capitalism to create the incentives for these kinds of investments.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this is global problem.  We will have to develop trade organizations that dictate where we import goods from based upon associated carbon.

Although I can say I would likely agree with all of them.  <br/><br/>The root cause of violence is the indellible influences humans receive as infants or toddlers from their parents (or parent).  Spanking is violence.  To a 20 or 40 pound human, a tap on the bottom is like an adult getting hit by a Buick.  Furthermore, the spank enters the child's learning process never to be forgotten, ""hardwired"" as it were. The learning includes a message that violence is an appropriate and effective way for the spanker to get what the spanker wants; that physical pain is certain to help change behavior.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  But that's only the beginning.<br/><br/>Emotional violence is quiet and insidious by comparison, but no less harmful to a child.  <br/><br/>Transfering a culture of violence (in the form of spamking for example) is socially problematic for all children.

Additionally, the provider lists are woefully inaccurate and it appears that a number of doctors on any given plan that we can access are not taking new patients.

What they do do, however, is teach you how to be more likely to select the correct answers. That's what test prep is and should be about. <br/><br/>But in K-12 schools, the tail is wagging the dog in that students aren't receiving enough time to learn in the first place as all of the emphasis is placed on test prep.

As independent forms of Catholicism bloom in the US  alongside American Roman Catholicism (24% of the public) and the unaffiliated (20% of the public) and Protestantism continues to decline (less than 48%, according to Pew Researchers), the dominant US religion in the coming years just might become Catholicism (Roman and non-Roman and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with Rome) alongside the ever increasing unaffiliated block of citizens.

Here's why:  Republicans say that raising the minimum wage will cause a loss of jobs because the employer will have no choice but to cut a worker to help cover the cost of paying other workers more.  The problem with this logic is that the jobs at the bottom of our economy are necessary.  In other words, the manager of a MacDonald's in Podunk or NYC only hires what they need per shift.  Altruism isn't part of the hiring policy for fast food restaurants and other small businesses that pay minimum wage.  <br/><br/>That said, it will cost employers more, obviously.  So they will have to raise prices or find other ways to economize.

Among my ten best women friends in tech, none are in the tech field any more.  Meanwhile, many of the men in tech I knew are still in it, most of them as VCs.  My husband, whom I met when we we both worked at MS, is still happily in tech.<br/><br/>I honestly think that for most women it's death by a thousand cuts.  None of them are that serious, but collectively, they take the heart and drive out of you.  Twenty years ago, while working at a major high tech firm,  I tried a few times to explain to senior execs that it was unfair for them to open meetings talking with male peers about the early morning basketball game they played together since of course I (or any other woman) was never going to be invited.  Mostly I got blank stares, but other times, I got the clear signal that I was in danger of being labeled as ""too sensitive"" or worse, as some kind of troublemaker.  I quickly backed down.<br/><br/>I really, really like most of the men I worked with, and I know they're good people, but there can be a collective blindness where they talk business and tech with each other, and then, with women - enter a completely different zone.

I've administered the tests to grades two through seven.  The average child does their best, puts effort into it and then moves on.  They don't fall apart any more than children normally do when confronted with challenging work. <br/><br/>We do ""teach to the test.""  What's in the tests is what we are supposed to teach!  The state tells us what to cover, and then the children are tested to see how well they got it.   It takes an average of 3 hours over the course of two weeks to finish the testing.  More in fifth grade because we also test science.  (Hurray for that, because some elementary teachers never got around to science - too much Picasso I guess.)<br/><br/>When I look at test scores, the scores almost always reasonably accurately measure how much a child was learning that year.  The tests are not at all perfect.  Common Core is a huge change in how we teach.  Scores will decline while we adjust.   <br/><br/>Prior to NCLB testing, there was no way for families to determine how well any school measured up to any other school, even in a single District.  With Common Core, we will at last get some idea of how each school measures up against other schools in the entire country.  <br/><br/>Not all children are above average.

They used data from tax returns spanning decades to determine distribution of national income. They found that national income overall grew by 1.7 percent by 2011 but by 11 percent for the top 1 percent of earners. But their findings are based on pre-tax income reported by tax filers, without transfers and without off-the-books considerations that are almost impossible to calculate anyway. But the impact of these factors is real.<br/><br/>I don't argue (and neither does this increasing group of questioning economists) that there is no ""gap"", but merely that it's not as large as some paint it. What I argue moreover is that, whatever it is, it's not occasioned by high earners making too much but by competitive factors in labor that are becoming historical and deeply entrenched, that are de-valuing the labor of lower earners. Yet, the ink we see from the left seeks to demonize high earners as a rationale for taxing them more onerously to more fully redistribute what they perceive as a pie of static size.<br/><br/>We need to confront this historical shift and de-valuation, not focus so intently on what the high-end makes.

The controversy is whether Congress purposely accessed classified information it was not authorized to view. What that information was - the detention program - is irrelevant, though the level of passion people feel for it confuses the issue.<br/><br/>Some government agencies, like the CIA, work in secret to keep information protected. Getting elected to Congress does not give one open access to any and all secret documents. Elected officials are granted power by public votes, not background checks. A drug addict can become a member of Congress if enough people vote for them but they could not pass a background check if they applied for a classified government job. Though Congress does enjoy more access to information than the public, it is not the same as an agency employee. Even if you think they should be given the same access, should their staffers get it, too? The article doesn't say that the senators went to the CIA facility to review the documents for their report but that their staffers did.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I don't believe any nefarious action was committed by the congressional committee.

This is an extended stay hotel with multiple bedrooms and kitchens - and, since she has the least seniority of the housekeepers, she has been assigned the wing where guests with pets are allowed to stay, where guests leave their pets in their rooms while they go out to the casinos, and where numerous pet-type accidents inevitably happen. But here's the real kicker: Since they are compensated at $5/room and not at an hourly rate, they get no paid vacation. Many of her co-workers work 7 days a week at this rate in an attempt to make ends meet, so it is disgraceful that they aren't even allowed a little compensated time off.<br/><br/>Your suggestions and caveats to what are obviously white-collar employers are cute, Mr Brooks, but maybe you should offer some suggestions to those employers who basically trade in slavery in the United States of the 21st Century.",2014-04-01 10:40:46,241,DJ McConnell,,NULL,11466263,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/opinion/brooks-the-employers-creed.html,1,1

No one ever got shot.  Students would talk about hunting and sometimes openly compare their weapons in the school parking lot, some showing off the new rifle or shotgun that dad just bought them.

Being self-employed means their retirement and disability is in their land - you sell the farm. The urban developers saw the land (it was cheap for other farmers to buy it) and they snap it up and the arable land- the stuff the healthy food is grown in- is now under houses producing unhealthy sewage and people polluting the environment. Now you have your producers further from the consumer. The further away, the lower the nutritive value. This is why I don't like buying food from overseas. And don't get me started what organic really means.  You really don't want to know.<br/>The corn as fuel agenda was pushed by 'green' people as a cheap easily replaced alternative to fossil fuels.

There is no segregation in Israel, Arabs vote, sit in parliament, can be seen at every level of Israel's civil service, from lowly clerks to to doctors, judges and diplomats. Yes there is discrmination, but it is illegal, unlike apartheid where it was the law of the land. When discrimination reaches the courts, it is banned, the guily parties punished. Would I like to be an Arab in Israel? No, but then I probably wouldn't be wild about being an Afro-American in the US either. However the plight of Arabs in Israel today is far closer to that of Afro-Americans than to Africans in apartheid SA.<br/><br/>The West Bank is a different story. I unfortunately have to admit that there are aspects of the occupation that do superficially resemble apartheid, such as segregated roads, segregated law and justice, and a civilian population living under a military occupation, Nevertheless I say superficially because unlike apartheid, which was envisaged by its founders not only as the permanent state of affairs, but as the desirable one, the occupation is temporary. <br/><br/>The day it ceases to be temporary will be the day Israel crosses the Rubicon and becomes an apartheid state.

Assertions such as ""Argentina was richer than Sweden, France, Austria and Italy"" a century ago reflects his endorsement of the traditional Argentinian myth of the golden age that implies that the country at that time was at the same level with the other great world powers. This is just not the case. Argentina experienced, without any doubt, an economic boom after 1860 and a large influx of immigrants -mainly from Europe. However, the country still lacked much infrastructure, human capital and relied mostly -like nowadays- on its agrarian exports as source of income. Argentina's economic performance became closely tied to the value of agrarian products from that day onwards without the development of any serious industry in the subsequent decades. The reason why the Kirchner couple was so successful was, therefore, due to the dramatic increase in commodities after the year 2002 that enabled the government to replenish their empty coffers and not because of their economic policies.

The natural mixture of genes (from different people) created each generation is approximately four thousand fold higher than the inheritance of mitochondrial genes (about 20 genes). In fact if anything the science would suggest it would be better to mix mitochondria from several individuals (mimicking what happens with our chromosomal genes) because any ""defect"" in one source of mitochondria would be countered by a good copy from a different one. To understand this, contemplate that most humans carry up to seven defective genes that could lead to life-threatening disease but do not because they are rescued by the second good copy inherited from the other parent. This is the underlying basis of the interdiction against cousins marrying in many societies (and the excess of genetic disease in those societies that encourage cousin marriages, eg. the middle east)--because it greatly increases the likelihood of both copies of the gene being the same defective one inherited from their common ancestor. This situation is analagous to what happens with mitochondrial inheritance--since sperm do not contribute mitochondria to the fertilized egg, any mutation in maternal mitochondria can be fully ""expressed"".<br/>This kind of IVF has to be the most benign form one can imagine because it affects such a tiny number of genes and does not actually alter those genes.",2014-02-25 22:46:22,5,rhodes,,NULL,11229489,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/health/fda-meeting-considers-controversial-fertility-procedure.html,0,1

That's right: criticism of the Affordable Care Act, which might as well be called ""Romneycare!""<br/><br/>So let's also be honest about where Mr. Obama did fail: by trying so hard to be a centrist, and relying on Wall Street's own to solve the crisis, Mr. Obama did just enough to pull the economy from the brink, and to bail out Wall Street, but squandered a unique opportunity to transform America's economy and our society with it.<br/><br/>Had the stimulus package been constructed as Paul Krugman and other genuine progressives urged, every U.S. boat would have been lifted, not just Wall Street's yachts. There would have been more jobs, higher wages, better infrastructure, and a more robust treasury capable of paying for all of this.<br/><br/>But Mr. Obama lacked the bold vision for this, hewing instead to the lukewarm plan we got. His reward was to alienate progressives and have the GOP stand his centrism upside down, just as with ACA. <br/><br/>This truly is one of history's great ""What if's"" and will likely be viewed someday as why Mr. Obama was not the transformational leader many thought he would be.<br/><br/>@ricfouad",2014-02-23 05:13:15,121,Ric Fouad,,NULL,11211041,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/what-the-stimulus-accomplished.html,1,1

(my relatives just sold property, realizing a significant gain... but quite a bit went to capital gains and considering they bought it in 1987, their accountant told them it was not a great investment)<br/><br/>It's worth asking if there are fundamental, non-policy reasons for returns going to capital instead of labor.

It was very smooth, but with character -- not complicated like the Bordeaux, but a serious wine.  It felt alive and vibrant.  It was easy to drink.  It felt smooth in the mouth.  One sip made us want more.  It was a cheerful, smooth wine, easy in the mouth and easy going down.  Our first impression was that we could drink bottles of this.  When I first tasted it, my instinct was, ""Let's order a case.""  It would be a wonderful wine to serve with aperitifs or at a party.  It made us feel cheerful and happy, like spring is here.

Direct genetic modification is a powerful improvement on, rather than a radical departure from, traditional breeding methods, and with proper regulation (e.g., ensuring that farmers contain their GMO crops if there are concerns that such crops are outcompeting other local species), it has the potential to mitigate the tremendous environmental impacts currently involved in global agriculture.<br/><br/>So yes, GM could be a problem, BUT it could also be a solution, if employed and regulated appropriately.",2014-02-03 06:36:11,4,David,,NULL,11082130,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/opinion/we-need-gmo-wheat.html,0,1

Also, the state refuses to expand Medicaid, so I predict that hospitals are going to suffer relative to hospitals in more enlightened states.

309629,NULL,"I question the colloquial concept of redistribution.  Conventionally, redistribution means taxing - taking part of ""what one earns"" - and spending.  So when the word ""redistribution"" is invoked, it is associated with a negative emotional sense; they're ""taking my money"".<br/><br/>But I argue that all economic systems are 100 percent redistributive.  The inputs are, crudely, work and capital.  The outputs are income and products.  The formula that translates inputs to outputs *distributes* the benefits of the activity.<br/><br/>Now, Professor Reich demonstrated that the formula has changed over the years (link follows below).  From World War II until the mid 1970's, income was broadly distributed, median pay marched alongside productivity.

This is a stark example of the distribution function changing.<br/><br/>Recent work by Thomas Piketty (his book ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" is due out this month) suggests that the flatline distribution of the most recent 40 years is the norm for capitalism, and the 1940's-70's version is a historical outlier, caused by uniquely disruptive global recession and war.

What we have is a patchwork of band-aid services that sometimes work but often leave gaping wounds uncovered. Notable examples I have seen in recent years: a paranoid woman who chose wrap herself in newspaper in a dumpster to ward of the cold at night, because her delusions told her that her board and care providers were going to harm her; a 61 year old gravely disabled psychotic woman who was released as 'stable' from a too-brief hospital stay to homelessness in below freezing temperatures, causing her to rapidly decompensate and end up back in the hospital; a severely schizophrenic man charged with 2 counts of assault with a deadly weapon, declared mentally incompetent to stand trial, who was ultimately released from state mental hospital to his elderly mother's custody, with no medications, referrals or follow-up care plan in the community.<br/><br/>Humane treatment, not.

First, the tax reform package is clearly aimed at married couples with children in the middle class so who does it benefit?

It provides little tax relief to the working poor couples or the single parent households who are much more at risk to raise children who will not succeed.  Second, a centerpiece of higher education reform is widening the state's ability to set accreditation standards separate and competitive from the current system.  The major problem with that idea is the logic.  If states or outside sources create an accreditation standard in their small geographical area, how does one evaluate the higher education across the country and compare one institution of higher learning with another?     Third, transportation reform in his bill depends on reducing the federal gas tax and giving the states flexibility to decide whether to raise their state gas tax to make up the shortfall.  Given the current anti tax climate, the likelihood that states would raise their gas taxes to make up the shortfall for the federal dollars they now receive is very small.

Suppose you implement a special graduated tax on incomes over $500,000 and you use that to provide a tax credit to households in the bottom 25% earning less than $30,000.  These low income households aren't going to hold on to much of this money, so where does the money go?  It flows back into the pockets of the 1%.  <br/><br/>So, the first order effect, at least, increases the welfare of the population without decreasing the absolute wealth or income of the top 1%.  Yes, there may be a 1 year lag between the time the income is removed to the time it is returned.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the economy would grow by about 3% ($500 billion of increased annual spending in a $15 trillion economy -- your figures may vary) due to increased spending in low income households.  That improves hiring and some of the transfer taxes are replaced as the low income households receive wages instead.  [The top 1% can also raise wages instead of using a transfer tax.]<br/><br/>So in year two, the transfer tax goes away and the top 1% control a 3% larger economy (3% greater wealth) with a 3% larger income.<br/><br/>What's good for the oligarchs is good for America.

For those suffering injury or major bereavement, after the initial shock the simple fact that someone is thinking about them makes a huge impact on their psyche.<br/><br/>While not in the category of the Woodiwiss family, I'm dealing with a ""new normal"" following a serious fall in France that left me with 6 fractures, undiagnosed by French doctors.  Near constant back and neck pain are my new normal, and while I look somewhat the same (only shorter), I'm not.  But the one thing I will never forget are all the friends who called, offered rides, and simply expressed presence.  <br/><br/>Few, except a few tone-deaf relatives, said ""you'll get over it"" or ""my back hurts too.""    I think the difference between a true friend and just a well-meaning one is how much they allow you to own your situation.  <br/><br/>Pain and loss are hard enough to deal with, without feeling forced to ""put on a happy face"" or be something you're not, just to make another person feel more comfortable or freer to talk about themselves.  And I think that is what Catherine Woodiwiss means when she urges others to allow one to simply ""be.""",2014-01-21 08:17:17,68,Christine McMorrow,,NULL,10991585,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/opinion/brooks-the-art-of-presence.html,1,1

We double-decanted for 6 hours and then took our first taste, and were astonished to find that the harsh-edge had gone off the wine.  It had a smooth blackberry flavor, with definite acid, followed by tannins at the finish.  The balance of acid to tannins was still shifted to acid, but the sensation is pleasant.  There is absolutely no sweetness, just a flavor of blackberry fruit, with a hint of currant-berry.  The wine was not heavy or grainy, just relatively light and smooth and flavorful, with a zing of acid.  Then, we noticed that an impression of ""cherry"" joined in with the blackberry.  I don't know if it was just a slight warming of the glass with time, but the addition of the cherry to the blackberry made the wine very enjoyable.<br/>As we started on our meal we noticed right away that the acidity of the wine simply went away, as if the chicken meat had actually neutralized the acid.  This left the blackberry-cherry flavor, followed by the tannins.

That is why they will be exported completely, making money for Koch refineries but not adding at all to our energy security.

There is a link between disease progression and relapse, and why it often leads to death after a protracted abstinence.<br/><br/>I question whether society has it right that abstinence is the ultimate goal. Many LEO's and moralists have only one solution: seize, prosecute and imprison.

They ignore the impressive reductions in mortality and crime in Portugal's decade of decriminalization.

There is, literally, no legitimate justification for inflicting physical pain on someone already locked up for crimes -- I challenge anyone to cite such a justification. But the justification cited for prolonged periods of isolation is that the inmate, for whatever reason, poses a significant threat to others if left largely in the general prison population. On its face, that sounds pretty legitimate and not at all a gratuitously cruel imposition.<br/><br/>Yet it's charged that the criteria by which assignments to isolation are made can be arbitrary and more a matter of maintaining convenience in managing a generally unruly population. That argues for better controls over initial assignments and a very jaundiced eye on very long confinements. But it doesn't argue for throwing babies out with bath water.<br/><br/>In the end, long-term incarceration under ANY terms is a removal from society and loved ones and must be very painful, regardless of the relative extent of the pain inflicted.

It's also hard for me to have much sympathy for her as she graduated from LSU, another good school.<br/><br/>Today, many top tier public universities are turning away as much as 80% of the applicant pool every year (look at the UC's!), and thus admission is not guaranteed anymore.  These universities attract a talented student body: science bowl champions, musicians, class presidents, and NFL prospects.  And if a top 10% high schooler with high test scores earns a full scholarship to his or her state university, then why not take that opportunity when many private universities do not offer merit based scholarships?  With more top 10% high school graduates taking these spots, it will just naturally decrease the availability for everyone else.",2014-04-07 15:28:27,17,TK,,NULL,11518513,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/us/politics/edward-blum-one-man-organization-keeps-watchful-eye-on-college-race-admissions-policies-.html,1,1

It is very scary to accept that doing nothing can sometimes be equal to or better than doing SOMETHING. But consider the following: If a lethal breast tumor with no effective treatment would kill my patient ten years after it begins growing and she is diagnosed at year 2 by ultrasound, she would live eight years from the time of diagnosis. If she is diagnosed at year 7 by feeling the lump, she would live three years after diagnosis. Ultrasound seemed to prolong her life by five years, but in reality, she would die at EXACTLY the same time - ten years after the tumor began growing. Conversely, if the tumor is highly treatable, she would be cured by year 10 whether she was diagnosed at year 2 or year 7. In both examples, earlier diagnosis did nothing to change real outcome. For those few women where earlier diagnosis and treatment MIGHT actually improve outcome, their benefit must be carefully weighed against the physical, psychological and financial harms that other patients will suffer from over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment. The benefit for a few might be harmful to the many. Women are not alone in dealing with this type of dilemma: Screening for prostate cancer has created similar problematic choices for men.

But that money is not going to Israel, it is going to Lockheed Martin, the plane’s producer.  Cutting military aid to Israel would hurt us more than the Israelis. It would also reduce our leverage on Israel which is reliant on our continuing supplies; we do hold a check on Israeli military activities.<br/>While the current Israeli government is the least good partner the Palestinian have had for an agreement, the Palestinians are also not thrilled with our peace initiative.   They have ejected better offers, most recently the Clinton plan was rejected by Arafat in 2000.  At issue is America’s and Europe’s interest in putting a permanent lid on the problem by going back to the 1967 borders (the Clinton Plan) but most Palestinians perceive that as a sellout, they want a return of Palestinians to Israel, an unacceptable demand to Israel because it would in short order turn the Jewish population to a minority in their own country.

After a search of the internet, we found the Chateau Bernadotte 2009 in a wine store about a half hour away in Delaware.  Dinner was Poulet Basque -- a sauté of chicken, peppers, onions and tomatoes.  Initially, we found the aroma to be of black cherries and other fruit.  After a while in the glass, that aroma changed to smoke from a wood fire.  The taste was on the savory side, which we found surprising considering the fruity aroma.  Over time, the taste got more woody.  The texture was of medium tannicity (not as tannic as a California cabernet, for example), with a nice balancing acidity.  The texture smoothed out as we drank it.  The consensus was that the wine paired well with the meal.

Instead of always making some legitimate product the scapegoat for people's bad behavior, lets place the blame on those who form addictions.

Coming from an immigrant family in the US, I understand that deeply: I will never be the person, culturally, I would have been had my parents never left their native country. <br/><br/>Further, the type of parenting that these women promote is perhaps even more heavy-handed than had the girls grown up in a Chinese American family.

Kids from impoverished households don't have the support structure to encourage them to stay in school, and lack of job prospects for parents (especially young fathers) can encourage abandonment of the family.  I'm not excusing these behaviors, but there are reasons (besides a lack of individual initiative) that make it difficult for children from impoverished families to break the cycle of poverty.  <br/><br/>Second, while not all minimum wage earners support a family, many do.  And while an individual may avoid working a minimum wage job through self-improvement, someone will always be working those jobs.  And why shouldn't a full time job be enough to live on, regardless of the skills required to perform it?  Increasing the minimum wage has two positive impacts; it raises up the lowest earners and it improves the economy overall because of the increased demand created by the additional spending of those whose wages have been raised.  Demand creates opportunities for investment, without which capitalism fails (as has been seen in this economy when corporations sit on piles of cash instead of investing it).

I attended a small, top-notch liberal arts college where teaching was the primary job of all faculty members, and they did a great job of it. They lectured, ran recitations, graded papers, and provided feedback and counseling. Research was conducted to supplement their teaching, and certainly was not the primary basis for tenure decisions. Research grants contributed a trivial amount to the college's funding.<br/><br/>Then I went to graduate school at a mid-sized university. The impression I had was that research was their main objective, and teaching was an onus placed on them in order to maintain the university's status as an ""institution of higher learning"". Graduate students were a source of cheap labor, and took on the more mundane tasks of teaching. Professors who ""taught"" usually just stood in front of a class and recited lecture notes. TAs graded papers, ran recitations, and did most of the real teaching. They were hardly prepared to be teachers, but in many cases did a better job than the research professors they worked for.<br/><br/>I don't know if Prof. Grant's proposed solution will work in practice, but it certainly deserves consideration.",2014-02-06 10:55:55,18,MikeH,,NULL,11108521,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/opinion/a-solution-for-bad-teaching.html,1,1

The SAT and standardize tests do nothing but document how privileged the test taker is and most certainly do not indicate anything meaningful about intellect, creativity, perseverance, collaboration or any of the other qualities that truly indicate how well a high schooler might do in college and beyond.  On the most basic level the SAT represents more of the marketing of higher education and the evolution of the test prep industry in the United States.

182576,NULL," I have spent many of my formative years as a child, adolescent and young adult on Staten Island and all of my 20 years as an addiction therapist on the Island as well. Addiction has been a force on the Island for years. It holds the distinction of being the boro with the highest rate of teen alcoholism and also has high rates of other problems associated with addiction like cigarette smoking, infectious disease and liver disease. The reality of addiction is that it is caused by biological, psychological and social variables. However, the first two variables (biological and psychological) can be mitigated by the last one. I ran drug prevention programs on Staten Island for over a decade. They were simple… you provide a book, a musical instrument, a drama play, or a ball along with some invested adults between the hours of 3PM and 9Pm and you offset the age of substance use initiation. If an adolescent does not use substances regularly before age 18 years the chances they will have full blown substance dependence as an adult is exponentially reduced. The epidemic of death and pain we now experience was a sleeping giant that was awakened in part by a medical system that perhaps did not understand addiction when the giant could not be fed via a prescription it went to a more direct form. Despite the sad facts of this issue, Staten Island remains a place of tenacity, resilience, desire for recovery and therefore a place of hope.

334293,NULL,"Years ago there was a horrid event in which a car plowed through a wonderful street market selling fresh vegetables and fruits in Santa Monica, California. A number of people were killed. In the court case that followed, a judge ruled that there should have been a better barrier at the entrance to the street, something that made it completely obvious that no one should attempt to drive down it. What I conclude is that some sort of solid barrier should be put across a street when there is a street festival or other large gathering in a street. If cars had been parked across the street in Austin, for example, the driver would have hit the cars and likely been unable to continue. People still could have been hurt or killed if they had been in front of the parked cars, but the numbers would likely have been lower.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Austin, where I once lived for a few months, has a history of these type of mass injury events. In two of the cases with which I am familiar, judges ruled that the drivers did not act irresponsibly, but were simply reacting to fear of the crowds surrounding their cars when they accelerated into people. In both cases, people on the street had been either attempting to confront the driver or otherwise pounding on his car.<br/><br/>Has SXSW gotten too big for its host city? A better question to ask, I think, is whether any city can safely have large on street gatherings and, if so, what stronger measures need to be taken to ensure safety.<br/><br/><a href=""http://terryreport.com"" title=""http://terryreport.com"" target=""_blank"">http://terryreport.com</a>",2014-03-14 02:03:08,2,Doug Terry,,NULL,11337545,approved,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/us/car-slams-into-crowd-at-sxsw-festival.html,1,1
